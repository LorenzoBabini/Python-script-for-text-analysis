The .ipynb notebooks are written reusing contents of Nathan Kelberâ€™s notebook retrievable in this repository: https://github.com/ithaka/tdm-notebooks.
Contents have been modified according to local needs (Italian language) and more specific uses.

The .py files are second versions, in some cases with more elaborated code and without textual instructions or explanations, to be processed using a Python environment.
