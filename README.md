# Python-script-for-text-analysis

Here are templates and notes for the main text analysis techniques, edited both in Jupiter notebooks and in .py files. A lot of scripts, suggestions and techniques are taken and modified from the Nathan Kelber's https://github.com/ithaka/tdm-notebooks repository. All the contents have been modified according to local needs (for example Italian language) and uses.
