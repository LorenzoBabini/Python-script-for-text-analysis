# data & tools

Here are tools for text analysis, i.e. useful files for text analysis.

**parole_italiane.csv** is a list of italian words encoded in UTF-8. In this list there are nearly 700,000 words (exactly 683,983), not only in the lemmatized form but also with all declensions and conjugations. This list has been created combining and mixing different lists and vocabularies, found on the web and in Github.

**parole_italiano_antico.csv** is a list of 491,386 words in ancient italian. They are taken from the Corpus OVI, in with there are no-lemmatized forms from the first attestation of ancient italian to the late of the XIV century, and dowloaded using Gatto Web tool (http://gattoweb.ovi.cnr.it/). To dowload this word from Gatto Web, I followed this path: "indices locorum per forme" > insert "*" and flag to all the boxes > "avvia ricerca" > "salva tutte le forme" > "procedi"
